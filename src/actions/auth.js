/*
  File should contain:
    - Import axios
    - 3 Action Type declarations, containing the different possible outcomes of authenticating the user: "Pending, Successs, and Rejected"
    - 3 Action Creator Methods that handle the following scenarios:
      - User signup
      - Verifying that the user is currently authenticated
      - User logout

    NOTE: Deciding where to redirect the user, based on what the outcome is, should happen within THIS FILE. It will require passing in the router's history prop to the action creator methods.
